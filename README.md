The Sample 1 page has multiple issues, let's first test it and then try to identify the issues. Think about what some of the issues could be:

- Is the page semanticly structured?
- Are the elements the correct ones for the use?
- Does the text have sufficient contrast?
- Is the content meaningful?

The Sample 2 page is a better example of a more accessible page. Let's test it and see how it compares to the Sample 1 page.
